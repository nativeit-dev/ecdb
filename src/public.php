				<h1>Public Components</h1>
				
				<div class="message orange">
					When you add a component there is a button called "public". If you choose to set that to yes, it means that other people can see that you own that component.<br /><br />
					
					The thought with that setting is, for example; You are building a project and missed to order one component, to skip expensive shipping costs, long shipping time etc. you just make a quick search on ecDB for that component and contact the owner. Hopefully he is kind enough to send you that component quickly for a small charge.
